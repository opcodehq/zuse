# Rust cloud implementation

Reference: original Zuse `2016cf4f0cc240e6797916dd5cab1d8bebab89ae`.
Target origin: `https://api-rust.zuse.sh`. Work takes place on `swarajbachu/rust-cloud-parity`;
do not publish to `main`. The [feature inventory](cloud-parity-inventory.md) defines parity.

## Milestone ledger

| Milestone | Implementation | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A: inventory/service | Pinned inventory; Axum service, WorkOS verifier, personal/org read authorization, existing catalog/entitlements, additive job/ownership schema, read-only inspection | Signed-JWT and PostgreSQL/HTTP acceptance passed; existing-account live verification pending |
| B: real cloud chat | Pending: providers/images/enrollment/gateway/mailbox, Rust guest, UI create/send/reopen | Pending |
| C: billing/admin | Pending: Stripe/Polar writes, ledger/export, provider credentials, images, machine administration | Pending |
| D: tools/integrations | Existing local tools; hosted routing/sync/device bridge/org automation pending | Pending |
| E: archive lifecycle | Existing local archive; legacy-compatible cloud manifest/status/retention contracts added; cloud backup/retirement/restore/delete pending | Pending |
| F: complete GPUI parity | Existing partial UI; complete reference comparison pending | Pending |
| G: migration/cutover | Read-only inspection added; ownership handoff, guest conversion, archive migration and live cutover pending | Pending |

Do not mark a milestone complete from compilation alone. Record tested behavior and remaining gates here.

## Current service

`apps/cloud` runs the hosted API; `crates/cloud` owns authentication, authorization,
catalog reads and durable job primitives. Shared archive contracts live in
`zuse_protocol::cloud`. No new history database or alternate local engine is introduced.

The current API is **read-only**, including PostgreSQL session enforcement. It does
not wake machines, transfer ownership, export charges, perform checkout reconciliation
or mutate legacy records. It serves only implemented routes:

- `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`.
- `GET /v1/cloud/context` (new: authenticated actor, selected scope and owner).
- `GET /v1/billing/entitlements` (existing persisted entitlements, without checkout repair).
- `GET /v1/cloud/workspaces[?projectId=...]`, `GET /v1/cloud/workspaces/:id`.
- `GET /v1/cloud/workspaces/:id/archive-status` (new: retained machine, deadline,
  backup/retirement/restore phase and verification progress; no compute activation).

Other feature routes remain absent until their behavior is implemented. Runtime-derived
native-agent availability is not yet returned by the workspace projection.

## Run

Set `ZUSE_CLOUD_DATABASE_URL` explicitly using a private environment file or secret
manager. The executable never falls back to `DATABASE_URL`, which can point to production.
Use a read-only PostgreSQL role for API rollout. Startup never runs migrations.

```sh
cargo run -p zuse-cloud-api -- serve
cargo run -p zuse-cloud-api -- inspect
```

`inspect` reports aggregate counts and schema readiness only; no tokens, user IDs,
messages or credentials are printed. It makes no ownership changes.

Configuration:

| Variable | Default / purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ZUSE_CLOUD_DATABASE_URL` | Required explicit PostgreSQL connection |
| `ZUSE_CLOUD_LISTEN` | `127.0.0.1:8080`; containers explicitly set `0.0.0.0:8080` |
| `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` | Existing production public AuthKit client ID |
| `WORKOS_ISSUER` | `https://api.workos.com` |
| `WORKOS_JWKS_URL` | Existing WorkOS JWKS URL derived from the client ID |
| `WORKOS_API_KEY` | Required for live organization membership reads; remains server-side |
| `ORGANIZATION_WORKSPACES_ENABLED` | Defaults false |
| `ZUSE_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION_IDS` | Explicit migration allowlist; default empty denies all org access |
| `ZUSE_CLOUD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated exact HTTPS browser origins; empty denies cross-origin browser access |

Organization access rechecks membership and separates content/admin/billing roles.
Only allowlist organizations after their existing rollout/GitHub-enrollment policy has
been assessed. Porting those additional policy gates remains required before broad
organization rollout. Personal records are never a fallback for an organization request.

## Coordination and archive requirements

`crates/cloud/migrations/0001_control_plane.sql` adds only Rust coordination tables.
It neither replaces original `api_*` tables nor assigns any resource to Rust.
Apply it explicitly to an isolated test database first. Jobs require a matching
Rust owner and generation before claim; enqueue belongs to the same transaction as
the eventual lifecycle intent. Reconcilers must additionally fence provider effects
and acknowledge results in the resource transaction before production activation.

Archive expiry is ten days and never implies history deletion. Legacy deadlines
are preserved or shortened to that window. A verified manifest/chunk count and a
persisted retirement phase are required to report backup verification. This status
reader alone cannot authorize machine deletion. Full backup/restore helpers,
verification, signed capabilities, source-machine fencing and explicit-delete purge
are still pending. Recovery stays disabled until provider acceptance passes.

## Focused verification

Use a disposable localhost PostgreSQL database with a separate test URL:

```sh
cargo test -p zuse-cloud
ZUSE_CLOUD_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user@127.0.0.1:5432/test \
  cargo test -p zuse-cloud --test postgres -- --ignored
cargo test -p zuse-protocol cloud::tests
```

The PostgreSQL scenario creates and removes only a generated test schema. It covers
actual HTTP routing, personal isolation, organization sharing/financial roles,
secret-free catalog projection, archive reads without mutation, idempotent jobs,
competing claims, expired-worker recovery and stale lease rejection.

Verified on October 22, 2026: two identity tests and the combined PostgreSQL/HTTP
acceptance scenario pass. JWT acceptance uses generated RSA keys and an actual JWKS
HTTP endpoint; the catalog scenario uses PostgreSQL 15, original column names and
real Axum handlers. The deployed read-only Store reports its actual PostgreSQL
read-only setting. These fixtures establish local behavior, not live WorkOS accounts,
provider execution, billing, migration or deployment.

The built executable also passed local `/healthz`, `/readyz`, unauthenticated API
rejection and `inspect` smoke checks against a separate seeded localhost database.
Crate-scoped strict Clippy and formatting pass. Dependency-inclusive strict Clippy
finds existing unrelated warnings in `protocol/presentation.rs` and `plugin_state.rs`.
Container definitions and CI are prepared; Docker is unavailable in this workspace,
so a container build is not claimed. The configured existing database connection
was unavailable during a read-only schema inspection; no production write was attempted.

## Remaining external acceptance

Deployment to `api-rust.zuse.sh`, WorkOS live-account acceptance, provider credentials,
R2 access, Stripe sandbox verification, controlled runtime migration and physical
Mac/Linux UI acceptance are not established by local fixtures. Existing production
data and billing ownership must remain unchanged until the corresponding milestone
passes. The current desktop account URL remains `api.zuse.sh` until cloud compatibility
is implemented and rollout explicitly selects the Rust origin.
